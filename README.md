## Diagnostic Tool for mental health

### Inputs
1. EEG signals
2. Peripheral hysiological signals
3. Battery test
   
### Outputs
1. Emotional Profiling of the subject
2. Recommendation

### Task Assigned

1. Learn about EEG related characteristic from other EEG data 
    * Arithematic tasks
    * Visual Tasks
    * Motor tasks
2. Learned machine will then be used for Emotional Profiling.
3. Hence, fine tuned machine by using ***transfer learning*** will be used to give ***muli-labelling output***.

### Day-to-day tasks
